# Redlock

This library is an implementation of Redlock (Redis destributed lock)

[Redlock](https://redis.io/topics/distlock)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `redlock` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:redlock, "~> 1.0.19"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/redlock](https://hexdocs.pm/redlock).

## Usage

```elixir
resource = "example_key:#{user_id}"
lock_exp_sec = 10

case Redlock.lock(resource, lock_exp_sec) do

  {:ok, mutex} ->
    # some other code which write and read on RDBMS, KVS or other storage
    # call unlock finally
    Redlock.unlock(resource, mutex)

  :error ->
    Logger.error "failed to lock resource. maybe redis connection got trouble."
    {:error, :system_error}

end
```

Or you can use `transaction` function

```elixir
def my_function() do
  # do something, and return {:ok, :my_result} or {:error, :my_error}
end

def execute_with_lock() do

  resource = "example_key:#{user_id}"
  lock_exp_sec = 10

  case Redlock.transaction(resource, lock_exp_sec, &my_function/0) do

    {:ok, :my_result} ->
      Logger.info "this is the return-value of my_function/0"
      :ok

    {:error, :my_error} ->
      Logger.info "this is the return-value of my_function/0"
      :error

    {:error, :lock_failure} ->
      Logger.info "if locking has failed, Redlock returns this error"
      :error

  end
end
```

## Setup

```elixir
children = [
  # other workers/supervisors

  {Redlock, [pool_size: 2, ...]}
]
Supervisor.start_link(children, strategy: :one_for_one)
```

## Options

### Single Node Mode

```elixir
readlock_opts = [

  pool_size:                  2,
  drift_factor:               0.01,
  max_retry:                  3,
  retry_interval_base:        300,
  retry_interval_max:         3_000,
  reconnection_interval_base: 500,
  reconnection_interval_max:  5_000,

  # you must set odd number of server
  servers: [
    [host: "redis1.example.com", port: 6379],
    [host: "redis2.example.com", port: 6379],
    [host: "redis3.example.com", port: 6379]
  ]

]
```

- `pool_size`: pool_size of number of connection pool for each Redis master node, default is 2
- `drift_factor`: number used for calculating validity for results, see https://redis.io/topics/distlock for more detail.
- `max_retry`: how many times you want to retry if you failed to lock resource.
- `retry_interval_max`: (milliseconds) used to decide how long you want to wait untill your next try after a lock-failure.
- `retry_interval_base`: (milliseconds) used to decide how long you want to wait untill your next try after a lock-failure.
- `reconnection_interval_base`: (milliseconds) used to decide how long you want to wait until your next try after a redis-disconnection
- `reconnection_interval_max`: (milliseconds) used to decide how long you want to wait until your next try after a redis-disconnection
- `servers`: host, port and auth settings for each redis-server. this amount must be odd. Auth can be omitted if no authentication is reaquired

#### How long you want to wait until your next try after a redis-disconnection or lock-failure

the interval(milliseconds) is decided by following calculation.

```
min(XXX_interval_max, (XXX_interval_base * (attempts_count ** 2)))
```

### Cluster Mode

```elixir
readlock_opts = [

  pool_size:                  2,
  drift_factor:               0.01,
  max_retry:                  3,
  retry_interval_base:        300,
  retry_interval_max:         3_000,
  reconnection_interval_base: 500,
  reconnection_interval_max:  5_000,

  cluster: [
    # first node
    [
      # you must set odd number of server
      [host: "redis1.example.com", port: 6379, auth: password],
      [host: "redis2.example.com", port: 6379, auth: password],
      [host: "redis3.example.com", port: 6379, auth: password]
    ],
    # second node
    [
      # you must set odd number of server
      [host: "redis4.example.com", port: 6379],
      [host: "redis5.example.com", port: 6379],
      [host: "redis6.example.com", port: 6379]
    ],
    # third node
    [
      # you must set odd number of server
      [host: "redis7.example.com", port: 6379],
      [host: "redis8.example.com", port: 6379],
      [host: "redis9.example.com", port: 6379]
    ]
  ]

]
```

Set `cluster` option instead of `servers`, then Redlock works as cluster mode.
When you want to lock some resource, Redlock chooses a node depends on a resource key with consistent-hashing way (ketama algorithm using md5).
